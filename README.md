# FlowerShop
A classic website created by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery Mobile. 
The application also had access to a database created by me with xampp and phpmyadmin via PHP and SQL. 

IMPORTANT! 
In orther to make the website work by downloading the code, you must have xampp instaled and the folder with the downloaded code saved in the C:\xampp\htdocs folder. 
Then you must turn on the APACHE and the MySQL server in the XAMPP Control Panel and write in the browser: localhost/YourFolderName/index.html.
